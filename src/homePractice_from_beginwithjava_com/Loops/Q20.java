/*        Question 20
        Write a program to compute the cosine of x. The user should
        supply x and a positive integer n. We compute the cosine of x using
        the series and the computation should use all terms in the series up
        through the term involving xn

        cos x = 1 - x2/2! + x4/4! - x6/6! .....         */
